                                        <p > Vancouver, British Columbia –  TheNewswire - August 23, 2022 – Exploits Discovery Corp. (CSE:NFLD) (OTC:NFLDF) (FSE:634) (the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has commenced its 2022 drilling campaign at its Titan gold target located approximately 42 kilometres north-northeast of New Found Gold’s Keats-Lotto high grade gold discovery. The initial drilling consists of approximately 10 – 15 diamond drill holes totalling approximately 3,500 metres. The Company plans to employ 'fan-style' drilling patterns with several inclined undercuts testing subparallel mineralization with potential continuity at depth. Titan is highlighted by historic drilling intercepts of up to 10.22 g/t Au over 3.35 metres in drill core (historic drill hole WP-1; Crosshair Exploration, 2004) and recent Exploits’ rock samples returning values of up to 57.5 g/t Au. Exploits believes that the past drilling, only 1,559 metres over 20 shallow holes, was insufficient and drilling is warranted. <a href="https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/2818-cse/nfld/126721-exploits-commences-drilling-at-titan-gold-target.html" target="_blank">Read More..</a> </p>

Prospector Shawn Rose did a good job of highlighting an anomalous trend from surface sampling over about 1 km as a starting point for TRU. In 2021 TRU expanded upon the surface sampling. Having now lived with the project for about a year, I believe that the IP data is firmly upgrading that trend in three dimensions, and the surface samples could be just the tip of the iceberg. We are pleased to have now developed many drill and trench targets over a 2 km stretch which will be our focus as the field season approaches.” <a href="https://www.trupreciousmetals.com/news-page/tru-releases-interim-ip-survey-results-over-gold-and-copper-showings" target="_blank">Read More..</a> </p>

Simcoe Geoscience Ltd. has been contracted to manage and interpret the survey using Riaz Mirza, a senior geophysicist, the same person who interpreted MT surveys for Seabridge Gold on their KSM property and for Pretium Resources on their Brucejack property.   Simcoe is also managing and interpreting a very recently completed MT survey on Teuton’s joint ventured Treaty Creek property for Tudor Gold and also on Teuton’s farmed-out Orion property, also for Tudor Gold.   All properties are within the Golden Triangle region of northwestern British Columbia.<a href="http://teuton.com/magneto-telluric-survey-begins-at-teutons-del-norte-property-in-the-golden-triangle" target="_blank">  Read More.. </a></p>
